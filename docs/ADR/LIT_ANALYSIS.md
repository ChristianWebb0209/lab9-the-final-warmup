Lit is a lightweight javascript library with some basic reactive components. 

For a project as simple as this one, building it out without Lit is easily achievable.

After looking into Lit, however, I feel like it is a healthy option for a project like this because it eases building out reactivity without adding a ton of complexity or complex new syntax like React. I decided to keep Lit and instead clean up the way we use Lit components here.
